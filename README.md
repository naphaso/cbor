The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format
whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code
size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
for version negotiation.  These design goals make it different from
earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.
